# Class 11: A/V, Practical Info, and Getting the Vote Tracker Started

### Overview

There are two main parts to today’s class:

First, provide a little discussion time on a couple of auxiliary topics, including the use of audio/visual resources in a web document, and also a discussion of the “Practical Information” chapter from the Duckett text that covers topics such as SEO, analytics, and site hosting.

Second, get the students started on the weekly code project, which is a vote tracker. It’s also more OOP. The goal for the end of lab is for students to display some number of random images from a collection, and keep track of which images were displayed and how often each image was clicked. This involves creating a set of picture objects from a constructor function that each have a name, a file path, times shown, and times clicked properties, and maybe others depending on the specifics of the project. At the end of the day, students should be able to render a list of image names to the DOM along with the number of votes each item received. Tomorrow, this data will be funneled into a chart library and displayed graphically.

### Class 11 Lecture: A/V, Practical Info, and Getting the Vote Tracker Started

* Code Review
  * Take time to review several submissions from Friday's lab. Point out some of the things that students were likely to get stuck on, such as finding the correct fonts, adding the dashed border towards the top and bottom of the page, and the horizontal line on either side of the icon towards the bottom of the page.
  * Clarify that they were not expected to turn in a completely accurate version of the assignment, but that the purpose was to get as close as possible in the time frame.
  * This might be a good time to talk about merge conflicts, if they encountered any on Friday.
* Review of readings
  * Demonstrate how HTML5's built-in `video` and `audio` elements work.
* Code Demo
  * Demonstrate how to change the `src` attribute of the `img` element in an event handler function.

### Class 11 Lab: Get Started on BusMall

There is a lot that goes into today's lab, so prepare students for a large build-out. The only new concept should be changing the `src` attribute of the `img` element to a randomly-selected image. Otherwise, the concepts of event listeners, constructor functions, and modifying properties of objects should be familiar from week 2.
