# Class 15: Code 301 Preview and Project Week Kickoff

### Overview

Today is the last day of classroom instruction for this course. There should be a little bit of review, but keep it minimal. It’s often fun to look back at a couple of their Week 1 projects to show the students how far they’ve come in the past few weeks.

The focus of today should be more on the future, including the immediate future of Project Week, as well as the long-term future of the students’ progression into other courses. It’s common to have a discussion on this day about the differences between the various paths offered by Code Fellows at the 401 level, and maybe solicit a guest lecture from the instructors of those courses.

From the perspective of preparing students who are advancing to Code 301, especially those starting that course very soon, it is helpful to give them some pointers on how to get ready. Thus, this class often includes a lecture to introduce jQuery and offers some resources to learn about it.

In addition, it is useful on this day to bring up the webpage with the description of Code 301, go through and give an overview of each topic, and allow students to ask as many questions as they have. This is typically one of the least-planned course days, but one that students consistently cite on their surveys as being one of their favorites.

As for Project Week preparation, by the end of class today students should be assembled into teams, have their project descriptions to work from, have reviewed the final project Canvas assignment in class, and have been instructed on how to manage team projects.

### Class 15 Lab: Merge Conflicts with Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alice

This lab activity should be completed as a project group. It is an exercise in dealing with potential merge conflicts. It should take approximately an hour to complete. Other than that, the rest of the day should be devoted to project planning.
