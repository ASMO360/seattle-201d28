# Week 2: Building a Basic Web App for a Retail Chain

### Overview
This is the big sink-or-swim week for many students. The overall technical challenge increases significantly as we use JavaScript to compute, create, and display data (presented in lists on Monday, and tables on Tuesday). On Wednesday, weâ€™ll add a HTML form to the application, which necessitates a number of brand-new parts of HTML that they have not seen before. It also opens the door to the world of JavaScript events, which is foreign to them and introduces them to asynchronous operations, forcing their code to be written more modularly and more elegantly.

On Thursday and Friday, there is a much deeper exploration of CSS layout than was done last week, and again, a lot of it is brand new to the students, particularly the bits about grid systems. It is very important to keep in mind that CSS layout topics from last week cannot be overstressed, and all new CSS layout this week should be viewed as extensions of that material.

Managing the students is critical this week. The challenge that they face needs to be dialed up from last week, and they need to sweat and struggle a bit. The TAs need to be reminded to not give away too many answers or lend assistance that is too obvious. By class time on Wednesday morning, and certainly by midday, you should have a good feel for which students are the most at risk. As stated previously, attrition of 10-20% is not uncommon in this course, and this is the week when most of it happens. Be sure to stay communicative with the Campus Director as you identify these students. Do not be shy about speaking directly and clearly with students about your concerns. They often find it to be a relief to have their struggles in the open rather than something they are passively worrying about.

One more thing: on Monday, be sure to go over the student responses to the weekly survey, and discuss the points that are raised. There are some things that you might want to modify, and there are some things where you want to dig in your heels and explain why we do certain things the way we do.


### Week 2 Learning Objectives
As a result of completing Week 2 of Code 201, and building the retail chain weekly project, students will:
* Demonstrate the ability to construct a web application of multiple pages that serves a collection of user stories and technical goals outlined in the assignment documents.
* Be able to explain and demonstrate how object-oriented (OO) programming is valuable for writing DRY code that is more maintainable, easier to extend, and easier to debug,  and also how OOP differs from other forms of programming, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
* Be able to appropriately use OO design to create a single constructor function that generates multiple objects representing the individual store locations required for the retail chain, and also provides a means of generating new objects based on data submitted in a HTML form.
* Be able to write code to model relationships between objects at a basic level, in order to effectively create representations of real-world entities in code and solve the associated real-world problems.
* Refine and then extend their understanding of CSS layout techniques to include grid systems.
