# Class 10: JS Debugging and More CSS Layout

### Overview

This is another big day for code review as the students in the class are getting their retail apps wrapped up. Ideally, at this point the students should be more focused on the look and feel of the app than its JavaScript functionality. That said, this is the best time to engage with the debugging chapter in the Duckett text, as it provides some reminders and refreshes on what the students have experienced with JS debugging, but also gets into some advanced and under-the-hood topics that they are now ready to consider.

The CSS layout component of today’s class will again depend upon the progress of a particular cohort. If more time is needed on the fundamentals, or in a hands-on exploration of grid systems, then that is what must be done. If the class is more advanced, however, this could be a day to explore topics such as CSS frameworks or responsive design.

### Class 10 Lecture: JS Debugging and More CSS Layout

Debugging Workflow:
* check browser console & resolve all error messages
  * look at file name, line number of error, and error type
* check for useful linter messages near the source of the error
* console log the value you are trying to work with
* note all of the places in your code that define or modify the value you are working with
* try commenting things out, then adding them back. work backward until you find the first source of error
* try calling functions or inspecting vars in console
  * is the value named correctly?
  * is the value defined?
  * is the value the right type?
  * does the object have the props/methods you expect?
  * does the function return the value(s) it should?
  * are you calling the function with the right number/type of arguments?
  * does the array have the number/type of elements you expect?
* inspect the HTML elements
  * do all the elements exist in the HTML?
  * is the HTML hierarchy correct?
  * does the element actually have an event listener attached?
  * does the element have all the attributes you expect?
  * have you mixed up a class & an ID?

### Class 10 Lab: HTML/CSS Wireframe Exercise

During lecture, continue working on the wireframe exercise together. This will help prepare students for their first timed lab assignment, Chocolate Pizza. This lab can be done individually or in assigned pairs. Students will have approximately four hours to work on this assignment, getting their project as close as possible to the recipe mockup. The secondary purpose of the cutoff time is to encourage students to head home and get some rest over the weekend.

The assignment is more about “crank through a lot of CSS work” than striving for an ideal solution. Present it as a puzzle, and encourage students to do it as collaboratively as possible to compare each other’s solutions. If good effort is given, grade for full credit. It's more about process than product.

The intent of this lab is that they dive in to a problem, come up with a plan to attack it, go through the mechanics of managing the image resources and setting up the HTML, and then do whatever they can with CSS. It hits a lot of stuff. And ideally lots of teaching happens while they are working, when the instructor circulates and gives tips.
