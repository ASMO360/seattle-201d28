## Live code

In our code demo today we'll be doing the following:

- Create a GitHub repo for our weekly project and `git clone` it
- Read through the lab assignment, translating it into a to-do list, and fulfill some technical components such as:
  1. Creating a basic scaffold for a code project
  2. Utilize `if/else` statements to handle conditional logic
  3. Add in some basic input validation
  4. Utilize good Git processes including **a-c-p** cycles
