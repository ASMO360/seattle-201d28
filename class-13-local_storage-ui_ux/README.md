# Class 13: Local Storage and UI/UX Concepts

### Overview

Code review is essential to a good start for the day. As with Class 9, your focus should be on getting all student assignments as close to functional as possible and getting everyone caught up who has slipped behind. Have the students with working assignments lead the way and explain their code. Also, ask students with incomplete projects and particular sticking points if they will share their work with the class to get assistance. By this time in the class, there should adequate trust all around to really do some deep code review.

The one instructional piece today, local storage, is straightforward in terms of how it works. The key is to make sure that all of the big conceptual topics are being covered as well:
* Persistence, whether in the browser or across multiple machines
* Techniques for managing persistence: when to store, when to retrieve
* What to store, exactly?
* JSON and data modeling

### Class 13 Lab: Add Local Storage to the Vote Tracker App

Some students will still be catching up from the first day's build out. This lab is also on the lighter side, requiring students to add local storage to their vote tracker app. Once the functionality is in place, adding local storage should not take too long. Students will need to be mindful of when and where they are storing and retrieving data. A common mistake is forgetting to stringify or parse the data.
